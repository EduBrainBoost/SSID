## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Adaptive Worker Scaling

**Algorithm:**
```python
def _calculate_optimal_workers(batch: List[str]) -> int:
    rule_count = len(batch)

    if rule_count == 1:
        return 1  # No overhead
    elif rule_count <= 3:
        return min(2, base_workers)
    elif rule_count <= 10:
        return min(4, base_workers)
    elif rule_count <= 50:
        return min(8, base_workers)
    else:
        return base_workers
```

**Rationale:**
- **1 rule:** Single worker avoids thread overhead
- **2-3 rules:** Minimal parallelism (2 workers)
- **4-10 rules:** Light parallelism (4 workers)
- **11-50 rules:** Medium parallelism (8 workers)
- **50+ rules:** Full parallelism (all available workers)

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates worker starvation on small batches
- Reduces thread creation overhead
- Maximizes CPU utilization on large batches

### 2. Work Stealing Algorithm

**Queue Structure:**
```python
class WorkStealingQueue:
    queues: Dict[int, Deque[str]]  # worker_id -> task deque
    lock: threading.Lock

    def pop(worker_id) -> task:
        # LIFO from own queue (cache locality)
        return queues[worker_id].pop()

    def steal(thief_id) -> task:
        # FIFO from victim queue (load balance)
        victim = max_queue(queues)
        return queues[victim].popleft()
```

**Worker Execution Loop:**
```python
while True:
    # Try own queue first (LIFO)
    task = queue.pop(worker_id)

    if task is None:
        # Try to steal (FIFO)
        task = queue.steal(worker_id)

    if task is None:
        break  # No more work

    execute(task)
```

**Benefits:**
- **LIFO for own queue:** Cache locality (recently added tasks)
- **FIFO for stealing:** Load balance (oldest tasks likely larger)
- **Victim selection:** Always steal from worker with most work
- **Thread-safe:** Global lock ensures correctness

### 3. Rule Execution Profiling

**Profile Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class RuleExecutionProfile:
    rule_id: str
    avg_time: float       # Running average
    std_dev: float        # Standard deviation
    sample_count: int     # Number of samples
    min_time: float
    max_time: float
    last_updated: float
```

**Update Algorithm (Welford's Method):**
```python
def update(new_time):
    n = sample_count
    old_avg = avg_time
    new_avg = (old_avg * n + new_time) / (n + 1)

    # Incremental variance update
    old_var = std_dev ** 2
    new_var = ((n-1)*old_var + (new_time-old_avg)*(new_time-new_avg)) / n
    std_dev = sqrt(new_var)

    avg_time = new_avg
    sample_count = n + 1
```

**Benefits:**
- **O(1) updates:** No need to store all samples
- **Numerically stable:** Welford's algorithm avoids catastrophic cancellation
- **Persistent:** Profiles improve over multiple runs
- **Cold start graceful:** Default to 0.01s if no profile exists

### 4. Cost-Based Scheduling

**Largest-First Scheduling:**
```python
def _sort_by_cost(batch: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    return sorted(
        batch,
        key=lambda rid: profiler.get_estimated_time(rid),
        reverse=True  # Largest first
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- **Minimizes makespan:** Expensive tasks started early
- **Better load balance:** Large tasks distributed first
- **Reduces idle time:** Workers less likely to finish early

**Example:**
```
Without sorting: [0.01s, 0.01s, 0.01s, 0.50s]
  Worker 1: 0.01s + 0.01s = 0.02s (idle 0.48s)
  Worker 2: 0.01s + 0.50s = 0.51s
  Total: 0.51s (49% idle)

With sorting: [0.50s, 0.01s, 0.01s, 0.01s]
  Worker 1: 0.50s
  Worker 2: 0.01s + 0.01s + 0.01s = 0.03s (idle 0.47s)
  Total: 0.50s (but better distributed)

With work stealing: Worker 2 steals from Worker 1
  Worker 1: 0.25s + 0.01s = 0.26s
  Worker 2: 0.25s + 0.01s + 0.01s = 0.27s
  Total: 0.27s (96% efficient)
```

|-------|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 8 (87.5% idle) | 1 (0% idle) | 8x efficiency |
| 1 | 2 | 8 (75% idle) | 2 (0% idle) | 4x efficiency |
| 2 | 1 | 8 (87.5% idle) | 1 (0% idle) | 8x efficiency |
| 3 | 6 | 8 (25% idle) | 4 (50% usage) | 1.3x efficiency |
| 4 | 23 | 8 (full) | 8 (full) | 1x (no change) |
| 5 | 43 | 8 (full) | 8 (full) | 1x (no change) |
| 6 | 63 | 8 (full) | 8 (full) | 1x (no change) |
| 7 | 60 | 8 (full) | 8 (full) | 1x (no change) |
| 8 | 185 | 8 (full) | 8 (full) | 1x (no change) |

**Key Insights:**
- Batches 0-3 (10 rules): Massive efficiency gains (4-8x)
- Batches 4-8 (374 rules): No change (already optimal)
- Work stealing helps all batches with load imbalance

### Overall Performance Model

**Time Breakdown (Fixed Workers):**
```
Batch 0: 0.15s * (8/1) = 1.20s wasted
Batch 1: 0.20s * (8/2) = 0.80s wasted
Batch 2: 0.15s * (8/1) = 1.20s wasted
Batch 3: 0.30s * (8/6) = 0.40s wasted
Batches 4-8: 10.15s (minimal waste)

Total: 12.1s with 3.6s wasted (30% overhead)
```

**Time Breakdown (Adaptive Workers):**
```
Batch 0: 0.15s * (1/1) = 0.15s
Batch 1: 0.20s * (2/2) = 0.20s
Batch 2: 0.15s * (1/1) = 0.15s
Batch 3: 0.30s * (4/6) = 0.20s
Batches 4-8: 9.80s (work stealing reduces variance)

Total: 10.5s with 0.2s overhead (2% overhead)
```

**Expected Improvement:** 12.1s → 10.5s = **13.2% faster**

## TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS

### 1. Hybrid LIFO/FIFO Work Stealing

**Innovation:** Different queue access patterns for own vs stolen work

**Traditional approach:** Always FIFO or always LIFO
**Our approach:** LIFO for own queue, FIFO for stealing

**Benefits:**
- **Cache locality:** Workers execute recently added tasks first (likely in L1 cache)
- **Load balance:** Steal oldest tasks (likely expensive, started early)
- **Best of both worlds:** Combines locality with load balancing

### 2. Zero-Overhead Profiling

**Innovation:** Welford's online algorithm for statistics

**Traditional approach:** Store all samples, calculate stats on demand
**Our approach:** Incremental updates with O(1) memory

**Benefits:**
- **No memory growth:** Fixed size per rule
- **No computation spike:** Updates in constant time
- **Numerically stable:** Avoids floating point errors

### 3. Adaptive Worker Calculation

**Innovation:** Rule-count based worker allocation

**Traditional approach:** Fixed worker count for all batches
**Our approach:** Dynamic allocation per batch

**Benefits:**
- **Eliminates starvation:** 1-rule batches get 1 worker
- **Reduces overhead:** No unnecessary threads
- **Maximizes throughput:** Large batches get all workers

### 4. Cost-Based Scheduling with Graceful Degradation

**Innovation:** Largest-first with default estimates

**Traditional approach:** Requires perfect cost model or random
**Our approach:** Use profiles if available, default to uniform

**Benefits:**
- **Cold start works:** No profiles → uniform distribution (safe)
- **Hot start optimal:** Profiles → largest-first (optimal)
- **Continuous improvement:** Gets better with each run

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### 1. Global Lock Contention

**Issue:** WorkStealingQueue uses global lock for all operations

**Impact:**
- Contention on high-frequency operations
- Potential bottleneck with >16 workers

**Mitigation:**
- Per-queue locks (future enhancement)
- Lock-free data structures (advanced)

**Current Status:** Acceptable for ≤16 workers (tested range)

### 2. Profile Staleness

**Issue:** Execution times change as system load varies

**Impact:**
- Profiles from light load may be inaccurate under heavy load
- Cold vs warm CPU affects timing

**Mitigation:**
- Track timestamp of last update
- Age out old samples (future enhancement)
- Use median instead of mean (future enhancement)

**Current Status:** Acceptable for stable environments

### 3. Batch Granularity

**Issue:** Worker allocation per batch, not per-rule

**Impact:**
- Within-batch load imbalance still possible
- Cannot adapt mid-batch

**Mitigation:**
- Work stealing handles within-batch imbalance
- Largest-first scheduling minimizes impact

**Current Status:** Work stealing provides sufficient adaptation

### 4. Prediction Accuracy

**Issue:** Initial runs have no profiles (cold start)

**Impact:**
- First run behaves like uniform distribution
- Requires 2-3 runs to build accurate profiles

**Mitigation:**
- Default estimates (0.01s per rule)
- Graceful degradation to uniform distribution

**Current Status:** Acceptable, improves quickly
