description: |
  Unified compliance index providing normalized ontology across all regulatory frameworks.
  Enables cross-framework queries, multi-jurisdictional audit trails, and common risk assessment.

  Key Features:
  - Normalized control IDs across frameworks
  - Common risk classification taxonomy
  - Unified verification methodology
  - Cross-reference mapping for overlapping requirements
