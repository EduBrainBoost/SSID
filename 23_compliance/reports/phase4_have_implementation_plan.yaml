          how to contribute to the project and what we expect from community members.

          ## Core Values

          1. **Privacy by Design** - Hash-only, non-custodial architecture
          2. **Regulatory Compliance** - GDPR, DORA, MiCA, AMLD6 first
          3. **Transparency** - Open processes, documented decisions
          4. **Quality** - 90%+ test coverage, comprehensive documentation
          5. **Respect** - Professional, inclusive communication

          ## Getting Started

                Flat structure was becoming unmanageable at 100+ modules.

                Best EU VASP coverage (90+ VASPs).
