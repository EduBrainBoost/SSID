## Detailed Findings

### [HIGH] Unapproved HIGH-risk policies
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Finding:** 0 unapproved HIGH-risk policies
**Evidence:** `learned_policies/proposals.json`
**Action Required:** None

### [MEDIUM] Associate tier signer participation below target
**Status:** ⚠️ **OBSERVATION**
**Finding:** Associate tier organizations (ORG-D) contributed fewer signatures than expected
**Evidence:** Consortium ledger logs
**Action Required:** Monitor associate tier participation, consider outreach
