    title: "Privacy-by-Design Documentation Incomplete"
    description: |
      Privacy-by-Design architectural documentation is incomplete in 03_core/.
      While technical implementation appears compliant, comprehensive
      documentation of design decisions and privacy impact assessments
      is not fully accessible for audit purposes.
    affected_modules:

    root_cause: "Documentation process not integrated into development workflow"
    business_impact: "medium"
    regulatory_risk: "medium"
    recommendation: |
      1. Create comprehensive Privacy-by-Design architecture document
      2. Include DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) results
      3. Document all privacy design patterns implemented
      4. Integrate documentation requirements into PR review checklist

    title: "Disaster Recovery Tests Manual Only"
    description: |
      Disaster recovery and business continuity tests are currently
      executed manually. Automation of these tests would improve
      consistency and ensure regular validation of recovery procedures.

    recommendation: |
      1. Develop automated DR test scenarios
      2. Integrate DR tests into CI/CD pipeline
      3. Schedule quarterly automated DR drills
      4. Document test results in compliance evidence

    title: "Custody Validation Proof Incomplete"
    description: |
      Non-custodial architecture is implemented correctly at technical level,
      but cryptographic proof of non-custody is not yet integrated with
      on-chain verification smart contract (ComplianceProofVerifier.sol).
      This is critical for MiCA Art. 82 compliance demonstration.

    root_cause: "Smart contract integration delayed pending security audit"
    business_impact: "high"
    regulatory_risk: "critical"
    recommendation: |
      URGENT - Complete by 2025-11-15:
      1. Complete security audit of ComplianceProofVerifier.sol
      2. Deploy contract to testnet and validate integration
      3. Generate cryptographic proof of non-custody
      4. Anchor proof on blockchain via ComplianceProofVerifier
      5. Document proof generation and verification process
      6. Add automated verification to CI pipeline

    title: "STR Reporting Process Documentation Gap"
    description: |
      Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) procedures are implemented
      in monitoring systems, but formal documented process for FIU
      (Financial Intelligence Unit) reporting is not complete.

    recommendation: |
      1. Finalize FIU reporting procedures with Legal Counsel
      2. Document step-by-step STR reporting workflow
      3. Implement reporting templates
      4. Train compliance staff on procedures
      5. Test end-to-end reporting process

      3. Update CI configuration to display helpful hints
      4. Add link to documentation in error output
