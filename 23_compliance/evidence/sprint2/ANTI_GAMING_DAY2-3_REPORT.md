## Fixtures Used

**Anti-Gaming Fixtures** (created Day 1):
- `sample_valid_badges` - 3 valid badge records
- `sample_invalid_badges` - 3 invalid badge records
- `sample_mixed_badges` - Combined valid + invalid
- `sample_identity_hashes_clean` - 5 unique hashes
- `sample_identity_hashes_duplicates` - 8 hashes with 3 duplicates

**Usage:** 100% of fixtures actively used in tests

---

## Evidence & Audit Trail

### Test Evidence
- **Test Files:** 2 (badge_signature_validator, detect_duplicate_identity_hashes)
- **Total Tests:** 49 (24 + 25)
- **Pass Rate:** 100% (49/49 passing, 2 skipped performance tests)
- **Coverage Data:** `coverage_day2_final.json`

### Module Evidence
Both modules generate evidence reports:
- `badge_signature_validator.py` → `badge_validation_YYYYMMDD.json`
- `detect_duplicate_identity_hashes.py` → `duplicate_hashes_YYYYMMDD.json`

All evidence reports include:
- Analysis results
- Risk assessment
- Timestamp (UTC)
- SHA-256 evidence hash

## Risk Assessments Validated

### Badge Signature Validator Risk Levels

| Invalid Rate | Risk Level | Test Coverage |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 0% | NONE | ✅ |
| <1% | LOW | ✅ |
| 1-5% | MEDIUM | ✅ |
| ≥5% | HIGH | ✅ |

### Duplicate Identity Hashes Risk Levels

| Duplicate Rate | Risk Level | Test Coverage |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| 0% | NONE | ✅ |
| <1% | LOW | ✅ |

## Performance

### Time Tracking

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Day 1 Fixtures | 1.0h | 0.5h | -50% ✅ |
| Badge Validator Tests | 2.0h | 1.0h | -50% ✅ |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 3 hours)

**✅ Placeholder Final Elimination (50 → 0)**
1. Run placeholder scan with policy enforcement
2. Categorize remaining 50 violations (P1/P2/P3)
3. Fix all violations
4. Generate `placeholder_audit_final.json`
5. Verify 0 violations

**Expected Impact:** +5 Compliance Points, DORA-relevant

---

### Then (Day 4-10)

**Continue Anti-Gaming Coverage Roadmap:**
- Day 4-5: Dependency Graph Generator + Circular Dependencies
- Day 6-7: Overfitting Detector + Edge Cases
- Day 8: Cross-Module Integration Tests
- Day 9: CI Coverage Threshold → 80%
- Day 10: Final Evidence + Score Recalc

**Expected Impact:** +21% Coverage, +10 Compliance Points
