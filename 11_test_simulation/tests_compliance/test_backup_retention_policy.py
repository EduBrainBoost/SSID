test_backup_retention_policy.py - Lightweight Compliance Test for Backup Retention
Author: edubrainboost Â©2025 MIT License

Validates backup retention policy configuration without executing cleanup.

Tests:
1. Policy file exists and is readable
2. Retention settings are sane (keep_last >= 1)
3. Guardrails are properly configured
4. Scope includes only backup directories
5. No critical exclusions are missing
