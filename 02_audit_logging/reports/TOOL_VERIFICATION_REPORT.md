## Gap Analysis

### Major Gaps by Category

1. **SOT-V2 Rules (189 total)**
   - Python Validator: 4/189 (2.1%) - Missing 185 rules ⚠️
   - Need to implement SOT-V2-0001 through SOT-V2-0189

2. **Lifted List Rules (54 total)**
   - Most artifacts: 0/54 (0%) - Missing all 54 rules ⚠️
   - Categories: PROP_TYPE, JURIS_T1, REWARD_POOL, NETWORK, AUTH_METHOD, PII_CAT, HASH_ALG, RETENTION, DID_METHOD

3. **Master-Definition Rules (57 total)**
   - Partially implemented across artifacts
   - Best coverage in Contract YAML

### Complete Categories ✅

- AR (Architecture): 10/10 in most artifacts
- CP (Critical Policies): 12/12 in most artifacts
- JURIS_BL (Blacklisted Jurisdictions): 7/7 in most artifacts

- All lifted list rules (54 missing) ❌

### Contract YAML (80.5% coverage) - BEST PERFORMER

**Status:** Closest to 100% coverage
**Missing:** 75 rules primarily in:
- SOT-V2 category
- Some lifted list rules

---

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Tools

1. **Fix test generator** (generate_tests_from_validator.py)
   - Add individual test function generation for each rule
   - Target: 276+ individual test functions
   - Currently: Only 8 integration tests

2. **Debug consistency verifier** (verify_cross_artifact_consistency.py)
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Fix YAML/Test parsing issues
   - Ensure complete execution and report generation

### Phase 2: Complete Rule Integration

3. **Integrate SOT-V2 Rules** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Add 185 missing SOT-V2 rules to Python validator
   - Update OPA policy accordingly
   - Generate tests for all SOT-V2 rules
   - **Estimated effort:** 2-3 days

4. **Add Lifted List Rules** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Implement all 54 lifted list validation functions
   - Add to all 5 artifacts
   - **Estimated effort:** 1 day

5. **Merge Generated Content**
   - Integrate sot_contract_generated.yaml into actual contract
   - Merge generated tests into test suite
   - **Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours

### Phase 3: Verification & Certification

6. **Run Full Integration Pipeline**
   - Execute integrate_all_rules.py
   - Verify 100% coverage achieved
   - Generate final certification report

7. **E2E Testing**
   - Run complete test suite
   - Verify all 384 rules pass
   - Performance benchmarking
