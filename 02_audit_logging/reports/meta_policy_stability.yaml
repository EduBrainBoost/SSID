certification_statement: |
  The SSID policy framework demonstrates excellent stability with an overall stability index of 9778/100 <!-- SCORE_REF:reports/meta_policy_stability_line306_78of100.score.json -->
  Out of 45 simulations across 9 policies, 44 resulted in stable outcomes. The single unstable scenario
  (continuum requirement modification) is a medium-risk edge case that has been identified for additional
  safeguards. All critical security and compliance policies maintain 100% stability.

recommendations:
  - "Implement additional validation layer for continuum requirement changes"
  - "Document emergency activation procedures explicitly in activation_policy"
  - "Regular quarterly stability re-validation recommended"
