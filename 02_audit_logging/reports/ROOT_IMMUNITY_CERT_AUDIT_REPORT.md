# ROOT-IMMUNITY AUDIT REPORT (v5.3)

**Status:** CERTIFIED 100/100 <!-- SCORE_REF:reports/ROOT_IMMUNITY_CERT_AUDIT_REPORT_line3_100of100.score.json -->  
**Date:** 2025-10-14T18:37:01Z

## Scope
- Root-Write Prevention (OPA Policy + Pre-commit)
- Merkle-Lock (Proof-of-Integrity)
- Forensic Autologging (WORM, 20y)

## Evidence
- OPA Inputs: `11_test_simulation/fixtures/test_root_write_policy*.json`
- Policy: `23_compliance/policies/root_write_prevention.rego`
- Merkle: `23_compliance/merkle/root_write_merkle_proofs.json`

## Findings
- Active violations: 0
- Prevention coverage: 100%
- Registry state: CERTIFIED

## Conclusion
The system demonstrates structural impossibility of root-level writes under Root-24-LOCK. CI gating and policy symmetry are in effect.
