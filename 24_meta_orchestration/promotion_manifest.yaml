notes: |
  Blueprint v4.2 represents a major structural advancement with the
  formalization of the complete 6-layer architecture model. This promotion
  maintains 100% backward compatibility while adding comprehensive layer
  validation from L1 (Root) through L6 (Evidence/Proof).

  Key achievement: Zero violations, 100/100 compliance score, full
  governance approval, and deterministic 6-layer enforcement now active.
