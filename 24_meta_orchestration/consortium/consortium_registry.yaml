description: 'SSID Consortium Registry - Distributed Audit Ledger

  Links federated evidence nodes into a consortium ledger where each organization

  cross-signs foreign anchors. Creates a distributed audit network without central

  oversight authority.

  Key Features:

  - Multi-organization anchor cross-validation

  - Distributed consensus without central authority

  - Cryptographic proof chains across organizations

  - Immutable consortium audit trail

  - Multi-signature validation requirements
