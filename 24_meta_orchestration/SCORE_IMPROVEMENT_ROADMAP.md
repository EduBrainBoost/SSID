   - Generate certification badge

#### 3.2 Placeholder Elimination: 45 â†’ 100 (+55 points)
**Gap**: Many placeholders still present

**Current State** (from reports):
- Total placeholders: ~500+ detected
- Many in shard implementations
- TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholder comments widespread

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Generate complete placeholder inventory
- [ ] Prioritize by criticality (core vs. shard)
- [ ] Replace core placeholders first (weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Replace shard placeholders in phases (weeks 6-8)
- [ ] Verify 0 placeholders remaining

**Effort**: 20-30 hours
**Impact**: CRITICAL (affects code authenticity)

**Sub-phases**:
1. **Core Modules** (Week 5-6)
   - 03_core/*
   - 23_compliance/*
   - 24_meta_orchestration/*

2. **Layer Modules** (Week 6-7)
   - 01_ai_layer/*
   - 02_audit_logging/*

## Automation Strategy

### 1. Score Monitoring Script
**File**: `12_tooling/quality/score_monitor.py`

**Purpose**: Automatically track all scores across reports

```python
def scan_scores():
    """Scan all reports for X/100 patterns."""
    scores = {}
    for report in glob("02_audit_logging/reports/*.md"):
        matches = re.findall(r"(\w+):\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)/100", content)
        for component, score in matches:
            scores[component] = float(score)
    return scores

def generate_dashboard():
    """Generate score dashboard."""
    scores = scan_scores()
    below_100 = {k: v for k, v in scores.items() if v < 100}
    return {
        "total_components": len(scores),
        "perfect_scores": len([s for s in scores.values() if s == 100]),
        "gaps": below_100,
        "average_score": sum(scores.values()) / len(scores)
    }
```

### 2. Automated Gap Analysis
**Triggers**:
- Weekly score report generation
- Alert if any score drops below 95
- Trend analysis (improving/degrading)

### 3. CI Integration
**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/score_monitoring.yml`

```yaml
name: Score Monitoring

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday

jobs:
  monitor-scores:
    steps:
      - name: Scan scores
        run: python 12_tooling/quality/score_monitor.py

      - name: Generate dashboard
        run: |
          # Create score dashboard
          # Upload to artifacts
          # Send alerts if < 95
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Strict phase boundaries, focus on one phase at a time

### Risk 2: New Placeholders Introduced
**Mitigation**: CI gate that blocks placeholders in new code

### Risk 3: Score Measurement Inconsistency
**Mitigation**: Standardized scoring rubric, automated scoring where possible

### Risk 4: Burnout
**Mitigation**: Sustainable pace (8-10h/week max), celebrate phase completions

---

## Measurement Framework

### Score Calculation Formula
```
Component Score = Î£(Metric_i * Weight_i) / Î£(Weight_i) * 100

Where:
- Metric_i = Individual metric score (0-1)
- Weight_i = Importance weight for metric i
```

### Standard Weights
- **Critical metrics**: 0.3 (30%)
- **Important metrics**: 0.2 (20%)
- **Nice-to-have metrics**: 0.1 (10%)

### Example: Forensic Validation
```
Score = (
    Structure_Integrity * 0.20 +
    Code_Authenticity * 0.20 +
    Test_Completeness * 0.20 +
    Hash_Verification * 0.20 +
    Compliance_Finality * 0.20
) * 100

Current:
= (1.00 * 0.20 + 0.74 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20) * 100
= (0.20 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.20) * 100
= 0.95 * 100
=95/100 <!-- SCORE_REF:24_meta_orchestration/SCORE_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP_line354_95of100.score.json -->

Target (fix Code Authenticity to 1.00):
= (1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20 + 1.00 * 0.20) * 100
= 1.00 * 100
=100/100 <!-- SCORE_REF:24_meta_orchestration/SCORE_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP_line359_100of100.score.json -->
```
